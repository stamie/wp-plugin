# Loop Post Navigation Links

A plugin for WordPress that provides template tags (for use in single.php) to create post navigation loop (previous to first post is last post; next/after last post is first post).

This plugin is available in the WordPress Plugin Directory: https://wordpress.org/plugins/loop-post-navigation-links/


## Installation

1. Install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer. Or install the plugin code inside the plugins directory for your site (typically `wp-content/plugins/`).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress.
3. Use `c2c_next_or_loop_post_link()` template tag instead of `next_post_link()`, and/or `c2c_previous_or_loop_post_link()` template tag instead of `previous_post_link()`, in your single-post template (e.g. single.php).
