# TODO

The following list comprises ideas, suggestions, and known issues, all of which are in consideration for possible implementation in future releases.

***This is not a roadmap or a task list.*** Just because something is listed does not necessarily mean it will ever actually get implemented. Some might be bad ideas. Some might be impractical. Some might either not benefit enough users to justify the effort or might negatively impact too many existing users. Or I may not have the time to devote to the task.

* Add ability to define orderby (though it means not being able to use `get_adjacent_post()`)
* Add simple block that can output one or the other (or both) links.
* Add shortcode?
* Test ability to show an icon or custom text as link text
  See https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-an-icon-instead-of-text/
* Facilitate use of thumbnail (perhaps as '%thumbnail' placeholder) for link text
  See https://wordpress.org/support/topic/get-the-previous-and-next-thumbnail/
* Add examples of how to style the nav
  See https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-css-style-it-all/
* Add more unit tests
* Delete long-deprecated functions `next_or_loop_post_link()`, `previous_or_loop_post_link()`, `adjacent_or_loop_post_link()`

Feel free to make your own suggestions or champion for something already on the list (via the [plugin's support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/loop-post-navigation-links/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/coffee2code/loop-post-navigation-links/) as an issue or PR).
