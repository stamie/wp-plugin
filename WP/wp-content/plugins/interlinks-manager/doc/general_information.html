      <h3 id="interlinks-suggestions-meta-box">J) Interlinks Suggestions
        Meta Box</h3>
      <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks Suggestions</span>
        meta box is a tool that helps you find articles related with the
        post being edited and can be used to build an effective SEO
        internal links strategy with links that are natural for the
        reader and that improve the user engagement on the site.</p>
      <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks Suggestions</span>
        meta box is available in all the post types defined with the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks Suggestions Post Types</span>
        option.</p>
      <p>You can get a list of suggestions by following this procedure:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Save the post being edited (this allows the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks Suggestions</span>
          meta box algorithm to compare the actual data of the post with
          the other posts of your website, a non-saved post has not
          title, not category etc. and produces no suggestions)</li>
        <li>Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Generate</span>
          button</li>
        <li>Use one of the recommended posts or, if you are not
          satisfied with the result, click again the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Generate</span> button (the five
          suggested posts comes randomly from a pool of related posts)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can tune the algorithm used to find the recommended posts
        with the options available in the <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">Suggestions</span> tab of your options.</p>
      <p> To deeply understand how the algorithm works consider what
        follows: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Source Post Types</span>
          option determines where the algorithm should look for
          suggestions, if you select for example "review" as the post
          type you will get only suggestions that come from posts of the
          "review" post type.</li>
        <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Results Pool Size</span>
          option determines the maximum number of results placed in the
          pool of related posts. The five results displayed each time
          you click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Generate</span>
          button are retrieved randomly from a pool of results, which
          has, as a maximum size, the value defined with this option</li>
        <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Title</span> option,
          if enabled by selecting "Consider", increases the score of an
          analyzed post each time the title of the post includes a word
          that are also present in the post being edited</li>
        <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Categories</span>
          option, if "Required" is selected, tells the algorithm to
          return only posts that have at least one category in common
          with post being edited. If "Consider" is selected the
          algorithm increases the score of the analyzed posts that have
          at least one category in common with the post being edited</li>
        <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tags</span> option, if
          "Required" is selected, tells the algorithm to return only
          posts that have at least one tag in common with the post being
          edited. If "Consider" is selected the algorithm increases the
          score of the analyzed posts that have at least one tag in
          common with the being edited</li>
        <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Post Type</span>
          option, if "Required" is selected, tells the algorithm to
          return only posts that belong to the same post type of the
          post being edited. If "Consider" is selected the algorithm
          increases the score of the analyzed posts that belong to the
          post type of the post being edited</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I mentioned the score of the post in the list above, this
        value is used to rank higher or lower specific posts in the
        overall results of the algorithm, this means that when you have
        many results, only the posts with the higher score will be able
        to enter in the pool of results.</p>
      <p>Please note that the maximum number of posts analyzed by this
        algorithm is determined by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Limit









          Posts Analysis</span> option, you might consider to increase
        this option value if you are planning to examine more posts with
        this algorithm, you might also consider to decrease this option
        value if you have performance issues and what you want is to
        decrease the time required to get the suggestions. </p>

      <h3 id="interlinks-optimization-meta-box">K) Interlinks
        Optimization Meta Box</h3>
      <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks Optimization</span>
        meta box is able to tell you if the number of internal links of
        the post is optimized.</p>
      <p>As with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks
          Suggestions</span> meta box, the post being edited should be
        saved in order to get the actual status of the optimization.</p>
      <p>To understand what is an "Optimized Post" consider what
        follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">optimal number of
            interlinks</span> is calculated by diving the content length
          for the value defined with the <span style="font-weight:
            bold;">Character per Interlink</span> option</li>
        <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">minimum number of
            required interlinks</span> is calculated by subtracting half
          of the value defined with the <span style="font-weight:
            bold;">Optimization Delta</span> from the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">optimal number of interlinks</span></li>
        <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">maximum number of
            required interlinks</span> is calculated by adding half of
          the value defined with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Optimization









            Delta </span>from the optimal number of interlinks</li>
        <li>If the overall number of internal links (both manual and
          auto internal links are considered) of the post is included
          between the <span style="font-weight: bold;">minimum number
            of required interlinks</span> and the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">maximum number of required
            interlinks</span> the post will be considered optimized</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The optimization status of a post is also displayed in the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Dashboard</span> menu under the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">OF (Optimization Flag)</span>
        column, so you will be able to browse through your posts
        directly in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dashboard</span>
        menu and easily find which posts don't have an optimized number
        of interlinks. The purpose is that by identifying not-optimized
        posts directly in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dashboard</span>
        menu you will be able to fix them (by adding or removing
        internal links) without losing the time required to actually
        enter in a post to understand its optimization status.</p>
      <p>Please note that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Characters









          per Interlink</span> default value of 1000, used to determine
        the optimal number of interlinks of the post, should not be
        considered as a good or recommended value, you as administrator
        (or your SEO team) should determine which is the right value for
        this important option.</p>

          style="font-weight: bold;">How the link juice of a single link
          is calculated?</span></h4>
      <p> When the link juice of a specific link is calculated the
        following information are retrieved:</p>
      <pre>SEO POWER = The SEO Power of the post
TOTAL LINKS = The total number of links of the post
LINKS BEFORE = The number of internal links that precede the link being considered<br>PENALITY PER POSITION = The value of the "Penality per Position" option</pre>
      <p>Then this formula is applied to calculate the link juice:</p>
      <pre>LINK JUICE = SEO POWER / TOTAL LINKS - ( SEO POWER / TOTAL LINKS / 100 * PENALITY PER POSITION * LINKS BEFORE )</pre>
      <p>Please note that the link juice calculated by this plugin is
        based on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SEO Power</span>
        of your internal links and does not consider links to your
        website URLs that come from external websites. For this reason
        should be used to have only an idea of how much strength your
        are assigning to specific URLs of your website with your
        internal links strategy. You should not assume that the URLs of
        your website that receives more link juice from your internal
        links are considered by the search engines as the most important
        URLs of your website because search engines consider many
        factors.</p>

        the link juice and to get suggestions in the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks Suggestions</span> meta
        box might be pretty slow if one or more of the following
        conditions occur:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You blog has an high number of posts and you are not
          limiting the analysis of the posts with the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Limit Posts Analysis</span>
          option</li>
        <li>You have defined an high number of keywords with the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">AIL</span> menu</li>
        <li>Your server performance are below the norm</li>
      </ul>
      <p>if you want to complete the analysis of the posts in few
        seconds is therefore very import to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Limit Posts
            Analysis</span> option properly</li>
        <li>Delete all the unused keyword in <span style="font-weight:
            bold;">AIL</span> menu</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To avoid errors such as "Maximum execution time of x seconds
        exceeded" or "Allowed memory size of x bytes exhausted" it's
        important to consider that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Some server might have a limited maximum number of seconds
          allowed to execute PHP scripts with the<span
            style="font-weight: bold;"> max_execution_time</span> PHP
          directive, and this <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
          might prevent the analysis on your posts to be completed
          properly. If this is your case simply set "Yes" on the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Set Max Execution Time</span>
          option and enter a custom appropriate value in the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Max Execution Time Value</span>
          option</li>
        <li>Sometimes the PHP memory limit is very limited, and the
          analysis of the posts performed by this plugin might be not
          completed properly without increasing the PHP memory limit. If
          you want to increase the PHP memory limit set "Yes" on the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Set Memory Limit</span> option
          and enter a custom appropriate value in the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Memory Limit Value</span> option</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note that the custom <span style="font-weight: bold;">max_execution_time</span>
        and <span style="font-weight: bold;">memory_limit</span> values
        defined with the plugin will be applied only on the scripts used
        by the plugin and won't affect any script outside the plugin.</p>
      <p>It's also important to note that in some cases the custom <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">max_execution_time</span> and <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">memory_limit</span> values defined
        through the plugin options (and actually applied with the <a
          href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php">ini_set()<span
            style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></a> PHP
        function) might be ignored. In such cases you have to configure
        your server (or ask to your hosting provider to configure) with
        different values in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">max_execution_time</span>
        and <span style="font-weight: bold;">memory_limit</span>
        directives.</p>
      <p>If the <span style="font-weight: bold;">max_execution_time</span>
        and <span style="font-weight: bold;">memory_limit</span> values
        defined through the plugin option are ignored and your current
        hosting plan doesn't allow you to increase these values even
        manually after a support ticket, the only solution is to set the
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Limit Posts Analysis</span>
        option with a value smaller than 1000 and not exceeding more
        than 100 keywords in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">AIL</span>
        menu.</p>
      <h4 id="how-to-group-links-with-anchors"><span style="font-weight:
          bold;">How to group links with anchors?</span><br>
      </h4>
      <p>To automatically remove anchors from every URL used to
        calculate the link juice you can use the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Remove Link to Anchor</span> option
        available in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Juice</span>
        tab of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks -&gt;
          Options</span> menu.</p>
      <p>With this option enabled, if in your posts you are linking for
        example to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>http://example.com</li>
        <li>http://example.com#firstanchor</li>
        <li>http://example.com#secondanchor</li>
      </ul>
      <p>these links will contribute to generate link juice only for a
        single URL, that is "http://example.com".</p>
      <h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">How to remove URL parameters?</span><br>
      </h4>
      <p>To automatically remove URL parameters from every URL used to
        calculate the link juice you can use the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Remove URL Parameters</span> option
        available in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Juice</span>
        tab of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks -&gt;
          Options</span> menu.</p>
      <p>With this option enabled, if in your posts you are linking for
        example to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>http://example.com</li>
        <li>http://example.com?param1=1</li>
        <li>http://example.com?param1=foo&amp;param2=foo</li>
      </ul>
      <p> these links will contribute to generate link juice only for a
        single URL, that is "http://example.com".</p>
      <p>It's very important to consider that this option should not be
        enabled if your website is using URL parameters to actually
        identify specific pages, for example with pretty permalinks not
        enabled.</p>
      <h4 id="how-the-test-mode-works"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How








          the Test Mode works?</span><br>
      </h4>
      <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test Mode</span> is an
        option available in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Advanced</span>
        tab of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks -&gt;
          Options</span> menu.</p>
      <p>When the test mode is enabled your auto internal links defined
        with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">AIL</span> menu will
        be actually applied on the front-end of your website only to the
        WordPress users that have the capability defined with the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">AIL Menu</span> option. (available
        in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Capabilities</span> tab
        of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks -&gt;
          Options</span> menu)</p>
      <p>This means that, when the test mode is enabled, only the users
        that have access to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">AIL</span>
        menu (and thus only the users that can create or modify auto
        internal links), will actually see the auto internal links on
        the posts. This allows you to create auto internal links in a
        production environment without worrying about messing up the
        content of your posts.</p>
      <p>It's therefore obvious, but important to note, that if the test
        mode is enabled, your visitors and your logged-in users that
        don't have the required capability, won't see any auto internal
        link applied to your posts.</p>
      <p>Please also note that while in test mode, the data and
        statistics generated in the back-end of the plugin will consider
        the auto internal links applied, this behavior allows you to
        have more information about your applied auto internal links
        before you actually activate them (by disabling the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Test Mode</span>) to your visitors.</p>
      <h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the Protected Tags?</span><br>
      </h4>
      <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Protected Tags</span>,
        that you are free to edit with the <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">Protected Tags</span> option available in the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">AIL</span> tab of the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Interlinks -&gt; Options</span>
        menu, allow you to not apply the auto internal links on specific
        tags present in your posts.</p>
      <p>Let's say that you have created an auto internal link that
        converts the word<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>"dreamer"








        to a link, but you don't want to convert the word "dreamer"
        inside a blockquote element with the quote "You may say that I'm
        a dreamer but I'm not the only one". You can solve the problem
        simply by adding the tag "blockquote" in the list of protected
        tags.</p>
      <p>Please note that by protecting non-void tags you prevent any
        nested element from having applied an auto internal link.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Site Address (URL)</span>
        option available in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Settings








          -&gt; General</span> menu is used to distinguish between your
        internal and external links. This means that every link that
        points to an internal link should start with the value of the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Site Address (URL)</span> to be
        detected by the regular expressions used to analyze the content
        of the posts.</p>
      <h4 id="why-my-manual-internal-links-are-not-detected"><span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Why my manual internal links are
          not detected?</span><br>
      </h4>
      <p>The regular expressions used to detect the manual internal
        links in the posts are made to detect links with the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">a</span> elements defined using the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML5 syntax defined by
          the W3C </a>and with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">href</span>
        attribute that starts with the value of the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Site Address (URL)</span> option
        (available in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Settings
          -&gt; General</span> menu).</p>
      <p>You should also consider that the internal links applied
        through shortcodes are not parsed, the reason is that shortcodes
        might have different behaviors if applied on the actual posts in
        the front-end or during the analysis of the posts performed by
        the plugin, and this would produce unreliable results.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>The "Generic" boundary available in the select box of the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Left Boundary</span> and <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Right Boundary</span> options (in
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">AIL</span> menu) is a
        generic boundary able to detect transitions between Unicode
        characters and Unicode non-characters.</p>
      <p>For example if you assign the "Generic" boundary as the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Left Boundary</span> of the keyword
        "cat", the keyword will be matched by the regular expressions in
        the following cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>" cat"</li>
        <li>",cat"</li>
        <li>"-cat"</li>

        <li>http://example.com/mysite1/about/</li>
